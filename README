### Looking Glass - Python + Bottle.py

This is an application to run some Looking Glass commands.
So far, the following features are available:

1) DNS (Domain Name Service) - DIG
2) PING
3) Traceroute
4) NMAP (Network Mapper)

To start the app, you need to have Python (2.7 up) and Bottle.py installer (pip install bottle.py).

To run the server, change to directory where the files are available and run:

# python lg.py

this will start a web server listening only on localhost, port 8080.

You can change that, by editing the last line of lg.py code. change host="YOUR IP ADDRESS".
